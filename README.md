# Machine-Learning-Interatomic-Potential-UMA-Enables-MD-Simulations-of-MoS2-Doped

This repository contains a staged multistage simulation protocol for machine learning interatomic potential development and molecular dynamics simulations of MoS2-doped systems.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into four main stages:

- **00_base_files**: Foundational files, initial structures, parameters, and configuration templates
- **01_DFT_Validation**: Density Functional Theory calculations and validation scripts
- **02_MLMD_Validation**: Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics model training and validation
- **03_MLMD_Simulation**: Production ML-MD simulations using validated interatomic potentials

Each directory contains a README.md with specific details about that simulation stage.
