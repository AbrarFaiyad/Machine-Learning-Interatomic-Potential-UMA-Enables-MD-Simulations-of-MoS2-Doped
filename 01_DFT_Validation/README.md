# 01_DFT_Validation

This directory contains files and scripts for Density Functional Theory (DFT) validation:

- DFT calculation input files
- Validation scripts
- Reference data comparison
- Energy and force validation results

This stage validates the accuracy of the DFT calculations that will serve as reference data for machine learning model training.
